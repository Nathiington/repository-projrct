				The Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) Repository is basically a collection of databases, domain theories,
				and data generators that are widely used by the BIUST community including the students, lecturers, and any researcher as a primary source of
				learning. BIUST is a research-based institution and the main aim of the institution is to improve and advance <strong>Research and Innovation</strong> to help
				progress Botswana closer to a more diversified knowledge-based economy. Innovation is a data-driven venture therefore, in the Information
				Communication Technology field, innovative ideas need data to be tested and implemented. The current version of the web site was designed
				in 2020 July, by Nathan Rankopo, Thembi Sheryl Hadebe, Botho Kube and Boago Masego.
